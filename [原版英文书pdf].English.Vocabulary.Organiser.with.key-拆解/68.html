In Britain your first (undergraducate) degree is a BA (arts or humanities) or a BSc (science). If you do post-graduate study, you may get an MA or an MSc. After several years' original research and publishing a thesis, you can get a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Undergraduates usually write essays; a long essay is called a dissertation. A thesis is longer still and contains original research.<br>
Remember the different pronunciations of the noun graducate and the verb to graduate.<br>
